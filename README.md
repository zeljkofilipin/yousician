# Yousician

List of Yousician songs.

Yousician is a great application, but I couldn't find an easy way to list all
songs.

## Usage

Files with `md` extension (example: `guitar.md`) show screens for an
instrument. Challenges are listed in `challenges.csv`.

Songs are in `yousician.csv` file.

### GitHub

GitHub renders `yousician.csv` file as a table. The table is wide so it doesn't
fit the screen. Scroll it to the right too see all columns.

You can filter the songs by using GitHub's `Search this file...` feature.

### Desktop

You can save `yousician.csv` file and open in any text editor (Vim...) or
spreadsheet software (Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, Apple Numbers,
LibreOffice Calc...).
